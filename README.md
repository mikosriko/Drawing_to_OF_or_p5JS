# Drawing to OpenFrameworks or p5.js
Painting software that converts the drawing into lines of code that can be copy pasted into your own OpenFrameworks or p5js projects.

The reason for this project is to eliminate the issue of spending too long on trying to perfectly draw shapes the way you want. No need to create them yourself anymore and guess how their properties will look until you have ran the code, then need to adjust it again until it is just right.

## Instructions
To run it, download the **"bin"** folder and run **"drawing_to_code_debug.exe"**.

Going through the project itself requires you to download Openframeworks at [https://openframeworks.cc/download/](https://openframeworks.cc/download/).

There will be a project generator which will create all the necessary files for you when including a folder that contains:
- bin
- src
- addons.make
